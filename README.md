# Introduction

This basically just serves some static html files you generated as documentation for some project - but:

- uses github oauth2 for authentification
- verifies if an authenticated user is member of a team

So you could have github pages you just share with your team. Non-public pages.

# Configuration

Every setting you will need is stored in the settings.js.

# Run

Just start the node server:

	node server.js
